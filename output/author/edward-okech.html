</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I was born some 31 years back in western Kenya city of Kisumu,
to Caled Okech and Juliet Seka Okech.I had a happy childhood, mostly thanks to my mom who was always around.
My Dad was a business man dealing in imports-exports of various commodities to and from Europe.I realy saw him apart from 
the few times he came from his exploits in London, Paris or Munich of which we were assured of goodies.
I had an elder brother and sister both were fifteen years my senior, i wasn't much in contact with them apart from my sister's
two kids who were living with us.My nephew Kevin and Juliet my niece were one and four years my juniors respectively.
It's was upto when i was in class four when i was told that they weren't my brother and sister but regardless i still refer to them as my siblings to-date.</p>
<p>I went to good schools passed my K.C.P.E went to one of Kenya's top secondary schools.Eventhough life wasn't that merry in High school
in terms of lack of school fees my mum did try.I finished high school and immediately started working selling newspapers on the streets of Kisumu.</p>                </article>

A million times wiser,
Father, brother,
He was all these.</p>
<p>Always ensuring i was better,
Yes a man of character,
A daily dose of criticism,
Kept my stupidy in check.</p>
<p>Many things you tried,
And many failed,
But your spirit never died,
You were and always will ...</p>
