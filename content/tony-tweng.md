Fifteen years older,
A million times wiser,
Father, brother,
He was all these.

Always ensuring i was better,
Yes a man of character,
A daily dose of criticism,
Kept my stupidy in check.

Many things you tried,
And many failed,
But your spirit never died,
You were and always will be,
TONY TWENG - MEIN BRUDER!!!

[Dedication to Anthony Okech my late brother]
